<pre style="background-color:#fafafa;color:#383a42;"><code><span>Dear Professor Li,
</span><span>
</span><span>My name is Junliang Hu, and I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by Professor Ming-Chang Yang. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of joining your research group as a visiting student with co-advisorship for up to one year, starting in the spring or summer term of this year. My visit would be fully funded through my department, Prof. Yang&#39;s support, and a CUHK overseas research grant for which I am currently applying.
</span><span>
</span><span>My research focuses on optimizing modern virtualized cloud environments through the integration of heterogeneous memory technologies, including CXL memory, persistent memory, and RDMA and addresses critical challenges in performance, capacity, and cost-effectiveness. A core motivation driving my work is advancing cloud infrastructure to enable tangible societal impact—a vision that deeply resonates with your interests in innovating system support for modern hardware.
</span><span>
</span><span>I have published two papers at SOSP/OSDI and submitted another manuscript in December. My recent work introduces tiered memory support to hypervisors, which I plan to extend to pooled datacenter environments by developing a tiered pooling architecture that combines CXL memory and transitional legacy RDMA for serverless systems. My systems research journey has evolved from implementing experimental operating systems and key-value stores during my undergraduate years to my current work optimizing the Linux kernel and modern Rust-based hypervisors. I believe that my technical background and research interests align well with your group’s efforts.
</span><span>
</span><span>Your pioneering research has particularly inspired me, especially Pond, which is the first to introduce CXL-based pooling system design for real world datacenter to the academia, and Melody, which provided in-depth details across different CXL setups. Your seminar at CUHK two years ago left a lasting impression and further motivated me to explore this collaboration opportunity.
</span><span>
</span><span>During my visit, I aim to complete my proposed project and develop it into a publication for a top-tier systems conference. I would also be excited to contribute to your ongoing projects on modern and emerging hardware.
</span><span>
</span><span>I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this opportunity further. I have attached my CV, and additional information about my work is available at https://jlhu.io. Thank you for your time and consideration.

</span><span>
</span><span>Dear Professor Xu,
</span><span>
</span><span>I hope you had a wonderful Lunar/Chinese New Year. My name is Junliang Hu, and I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of joining your research group as a visiting student for up to one year, starting in the spring or summer term of this year.

</span><span>
</span><span>My research focuses on enhancing modern virtualized cloud environments through the integration of heterogeneous memory technologies, including persistent memory, CXL.mem, and RDMA, to address challenges related to performance, capacity, and cost. Since the beginning of my PhD journey, I have been driven by the goal of conducting research that makes a tangible impact on society by advancing the cloud infrastructures behind virtually every online interaction.
</span><span>
</span><span>To date, I have published two papers at SOSP/OSDI, with another manuscript submitted last December. My latest work involved introducing tiered memory support to hypervisors, and I plan to extend this approach to disaggregated datacenters by incorporating tiered memory into serverless systems. My passion for systems research has grown over the years, from experimenting with toy operating systems and key–value stores during my undergraduate studies to navigating millions of lines of code, and debugging and enhancing the Linux kernel and modern Rust-based hypervisors in my recent work. I believe that my background aligns well with your group’s efforts in advancing infrastructural systems.
</span><span>
</span><span>I have been impressed by your group’s contributions to infrastructural software, including your work on language runtimes, addressing performance, scheduling, consistency, and correctness, since your early academic and industry days. Your recent projects on kernel-level support for disaggregated memory and the integration of emerging heterogeneous memory technologies, such as persistent memory, into cloud environments are especially inspiring.
</span><span>
</span><span>During my visit, I aim to complete my current project and consolidate the results into a publication for a top-tier systems conference. I would also be excited to contribute to your ongoing projects on disaggregated datacenters and emerging hardware.

</span><span>To: harryxu@cs.ucla.edu
</span><span>From: jlhu@cse.cuhk.edu.hk
</span><span>
</span><span>Hi Prof. Xu,
</span><span>
</span><span>Happy a belated lunar/chinese new year! I am Junliang Hu, a 4th year PhD student in computer science and engineering department at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of joining your research group as a visiting student up to one year starting from spring/summer this year. I will be supported by my department and my supervisor and I&#39;m also applying for university&#39;s overseas research grant.
</span><span>
</span><span>My research focus is on empowering the morden virtualized cloud environment with heterogeneous memory techonogies, including persistent memory, CXL.mem, and RDMA to address performance, capacity, and cost concerns.
</span><span>My goal since day one of my PhD journey is to do the research that will finally have an impact to the great public through the modern cloud infrastructure that is behind essentially every click.
</span><span>
</span><span>I have 2 SOSP/OSDI publications with maybe one more, which is just submitted last december.
</span><span>My latest work was about introducing tiered memory support to hypervisors and my  plan for the next step is to move a step up and try to introduce tierd memory for disaggrageted datacenters through modifications of serverless systems.
</span><span>I have always been a system lover, apart from playing with toy OSes and KV stores in the undergraduate days, I have now gained experience navigating millions lines of code, hacking and debugging linux kernel, as well as modern rust-based hypervisors through my last work.
</span><span>That experience gives me great confidence to further my research on infrastuructural systems which aligns well with, and will benefit greatly from your team&#39;s effort in recent years.
</span><span>
</span><span>I have noticed that you and your group have a great history on infrastructural software, including a series of works on all aspects of language runtime, including performance, scheduling, consistency and correctness, which dates back to your early PhD and industry days, and your recent works on kernel level support for disaggregated memory, as well as integrating other heterogeneous memory techonogies to the cloud including persistent memory.
</span><span>
</span><span>During the visiting period, I aim to finish my next work and fomulate the results as one publication to the top system conference. I am also happy to participate in your on-going projects on disaggregated datacenters and/or emerging hardware.
</span><span>
</span><span>I would be very grateful for the opportunity to discuss this possibility with you. I have attached my CV as the attachment for your reference. My home page is located at https://jlhu.io. Thank you for your time, thank you for considering this request, and I look forward to your response.
</span><span>
</span><span>Best regards,
