[Virginia Tech CS Letterhead]


Subject: Letter of Support for Junliang Hu - Overseas Research Attachment Programme

Dear Members of the Engineering Panel,

I am pleased to confirm my support for Junliang Hu, a PhD candidate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), who intends to participate in the Overseas Research Attachment Programme (ORAP) and conduct research under my mentorship at Virginia Tech.

Junliang Hu will be attached to my research group from June, 2025 to December, 2025. During this time, they will work on tiered memory support for modern cloud environment, which aligns with our ongoing research in enhancing systems support for modern and emerging hardware. I am confident that this collaboration will be mutually beneficial, contributing to Junliang Hu’s academic growth while also advancing our research efforts.

To facilitate Junliang Hu’s research activities, our institution will provide access to laboratory facilities, computing resources, and hardware equipment accesses.

I look forward to hosting Junliang Hu and working together on this research collaboration. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require further information.

Sincerely,
Huaicheng

Assistant Professor,
Virginia Tech CS
