I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/).
My advisor is [Dr. Ming-Chang YANG](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~mcyang/).

I'm boradly interested in computer systems, especially operating systems, memory/storage systems and how they power today's cloud environemnt.
My current research focous on how to utilize heterogeneous memory techonogies,
such as persistent memory and CXL memory, to address capacity and cost concerns in the virtualized cloud environemnt.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn) in Spring 2021.
Throughout my undergraduate years, I enjoy building various essential hardware (e.g. [pipelined CPU core](https://github.com/vtta/mips-cpu)) and software components (e.g. [JOS](https://github.com/vtta/6.828) and [rCore](https://github.com/vtta/os) OS kernel, [distributed consensus protocol](https://github.com/vtta/6.824) and [key-value store](https://github.com/vtta/kvs)).
I also participated in providing elastic block storage service for fleet-wide virtual machines of alibaba cloud using a large-scale distributed storage system in Summer 2020 as an intern.
