I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) advised by [Prof. Ming-Chang YANG](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~mcyang/).

I'm boradly interested in computer systems, especially operating systems, memory systems and how they power today's cloud environemnt.
My current research focuses on how to utilize heterogeneous memory techonogies,
such as persistent memory, CXL memory, and RDMA
to address performance, capacity and cost concerns in the virtualized cloud environemnt.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn) in Spring 2021.
Throughout my undergraduate years, I had a lot of fun building various toy OS kernels and KV stores.
I also participated in providing elastic block storage service for fleet-wide virtual machines of alibaba cloud using a large-scale distributed storage system in Summer 2020 as an intern.
